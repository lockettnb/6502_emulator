THE STATUS REGISTER

    This register consists of eight "flags" (a flag = something that indi-
  cates whether something has, or has not occurred). Bits of this register
  are altered depending on the result of arithmetic and logical operations.
  These bits are described below:

     Bit No.       7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
                   S   V       B   D   I   Z   C

   Bit0 - C - Carry flag: this holds the carry out of the most significant
   bit in any arithmetic operation. In subtraction operations however, this
   flag is cleared - set to 0 - if a borrow is required, set to 1 - if no
   borrow is required. The carry flag is also used in shift and rotate
   logical operations.

   Bit1 - Z - Zero flag: this is set to 1 when any arithmetic or logical
   operation produces a zero result.

   Bit 2 - I: this is an interrupt enable/disable flag. If it is set,
   interrupts are disabled. If it is cleared, interrupts are enabled.

   Bit 3 - D: this is the decimal mode status flag. When set, and an Add with
   Carry or Subtract with Carry instruction is executed, the source values are
   treated as valid BCD (Binary Coded Decimal, eg. 0x00-0x99 = 0-99) numbers.
   The result generated is also a BCD number.

   Bit 4 - B: this is set when a software interrupt (BRK instruction) is
   executed.

   Bit 5: not used. Supposed to be logical 1 at all times.

   Bit 6 - V - Overflow flag: when an arithmetic operation produces a result
   too large to be represented in a byte, V is set.

   Bit 7 - N - Negitive flag: this is set if the result of an operation is
   negative, cleared if positive.
